# REST
Creating a RESTful API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

Playing with a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with a little help from mongoose and MongoDB Cloud.

RESTful APIs are useful as it provides loose coupling--changes to a component will, ideally, not affect the operation of other components.

This provides architectural flexibility, code reusability, and assists in making software that is less brittle.

There are 6 architectural constraints defined by Fielding: https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm

These are:

1. Client-Server
2. Stateless
3. Cache
4. Uniform Interface
5. Layered System
6. Code-On-Demand
